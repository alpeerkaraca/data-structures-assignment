# data-structures-assignments

## Why This Repo Exists

Well as I've written in my README.md file I'm studying at Ondokuz Mayıs University and Computer Engineering Degree.
I tought like I'm writing some codes on C about data structures then why shouldn't I push them into my GitHub
So this idea brings me to this repo. Here you can see my data structures class exercises and assignments. There will be approxximately 10 Assignments with the answers.

### PS (For my teachers) I'll be pushing my codes to GitHub after the deadline date so don't worry about cheating etc.

### PS2 This note is for new comers please don't steal my code for your assignment at least don't do this at Ondokuz Mayıs University.

### PS3 If you decided to break PS2 then don't forget to giving reference to my GitHub Page.

### PS4 Keep Coding.
